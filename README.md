**Formula 1 Race Strategy & Driver Performance Intelligence Platform**

An end-to-end Data Science, Analytics, and Strategy Optimization system built on 70+ years of Formula 1 race data to predict race outcomes, optimize pit strategies, and simulate race scenarios using Machine Learning and Monte Carlo methods.

**🚀 Project Overview**

This project replicates how real F1 race strategy teams use data to make decisions.

The platform:
  1. Predicts Podium, Top-5, and DNF probabilities using ML
  2. Quantifies driver skill vs car performance
  3. Optimizes pit stop windows using tire degradation modeling
  4. Models Safety Car risk using logistic regression
  5. Runs 10,000+ Monte Carlo simulations to estimate race outcomes
  6. Visualizes insights via Power BI dashboards
  7. Deploys a live Streamlit race strategy web app
